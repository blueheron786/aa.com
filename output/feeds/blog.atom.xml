A video game.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, I first got my hands on Chrono Trigger, a seminal RPG (role-playing-game) that went on to become one of the best games of its genre, ever -- a veritable GOAT (Greatest of All Time).  The game follows the story of three time-travelling teenagers who stumble into the post-apocalyptic future, discover its cause, and do their best to save the future by adventuring through different quests that span multiple time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main characters', Glenn, stuck with me for many years after. Rather than being a traditional knight story arc, Glenn suffers many losses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His teacher, a heroic knight, gets slain in front of him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He gets transformed into a frog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He loses the legendary sword in his possession, retaining only half&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These elements turn him into a forlorn hero, as he undergoes a quest for redemption, which I found very interesting and atypical. And these elements inspired me, 30 years later, to write the Green Beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Beast follows the tale of Sir Tariq of Mirewood, ex-knight, cursed to become a frog. He, too, witnesses his master's death, and the loss of the lengendary sword. This makes him angry, very angry. A series of events transpire, and he begins his own quest. But is it about vengence, or redemption? Can you be a knight, following the way of Allah, if you seek revenge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Beast is my attempt to wrestle with those questions, to explore what happens when Furusiya (Islamic knighthood) and rage coexist inside a broken creature. Sir Tariq’s journey isn’t a retelling of Glenn’s, but it carries the same emotional DNA: the weight of loss, the distortion of identity, and the search for meaning when all the noble paths seem lost. It’s a tale born from childhood wonder, grown in the soil of memory, and shaped by the need to ask: what does it mean to remain true to yourself when the world turns you into something else?&lt;/p&gt;
